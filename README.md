# TVYN_Supermarket_Chatbot
A chatbot built using LangChain and LLaMA 3, designed to help users explore available products in a supermarket. It remembers users' disliked products and filters them out from the available product list. It also answers shop-related questions, like store name, location, and global supermarket trends.
